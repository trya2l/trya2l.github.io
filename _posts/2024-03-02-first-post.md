Well.

I'm not an experimented nor passionated writer (especially in english), but well, I need to start somewhere after all.

This one won't be really well organized (and I may delete it sooner or later). We will see.

This space shall become my lab, here I may organize my toughts (or at least try to, and learn to). I wish to expose my ideas, my projects, and to learn to document myself in a concise, but rigourous way.

However, I do not plan to push myself too hard, as this is were I learn. I shall accept and expect to see some failures, and try to learn from them.

That's it for today. If by chance, you come to this post, first of all have a good day (or night).
If you would like to contact me, to follow or maybe participate to this adventure (maybe you plan to launch a space like this), please contact me on my email (for the time being lalandu973@gmail.com) or tag me on Mastodon (trya2l@fosstodon.org).

Bye!
